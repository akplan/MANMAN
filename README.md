MANMAN: The Second(???) DLC
======
MANMAN is written in Lua, using [love2d](https://love2d.org/) framework with [kikito's "anim8" library](https://github.com/kikito/anim8).

What? MANMAN?
------
   *"MANMAN was a mistake." -- Nicholas N. McCorkle, [Placeholder-Name-Here]'s last CEO*
   
   [Placeholder-Name-Here] Games aims to revolutionize the way video games do DLC, through its best-known (and only)
   free-to-play* game series, MANMAN.
   
The Second(???) DLC?
------
   Yes. The base game itself isn't functional. The first DLC adds some functionality -- a menu screen (just a menu screen.) In this DLC, you get to talk to cacti. Later paid DLC packs include the ability to exit the game, save games (somehow never your own save game,) lavish anime cutscenes, superior voice acting, and crossword puzzles.
   
   Needless to say, MANMAN wasn't a financial success, leading [Placeholder-Name-Here] Games decided to change its focus from video games to mobile Pachinko apps.

But seriously, What's a MANMAN?
------
   MANMAN was a joke game series thought up by my good ol' pal [Logan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/logan-lautt-091b59b8), during a summer session of Data Structures. In between breaks we pretty much hashed out horrible DLC ideas for a horrible shovelware game.
